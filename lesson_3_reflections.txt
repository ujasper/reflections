-When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When I need to share my work with other people and collaborate with them. And also when I need to work in a different    machines, different places and to be sure, that my work is safe if somethng happen    with my computer
  
-Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  It can happens that I need not the freshest state in my work

-Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
  Fork  is a copy of some repository on GitHub To work with it on the other account.
  Clone is a local copy of the repository to work with it on a local machine.
  Branch is a new instance of working material which you can modify and keep without any influence on the main instance of material
  So fork is useful to obtain the copy of repository on different accounts, clone is useful to get the material to local machine and branch is good to work with material and keep main copy safe and sound

-What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

  It helps when I need to resolve merging conflict, because with it I can see diferencies which call conflict and so, I can decide< what should be in a merged branch.
  
-How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

  I can collaborate with a real life discussions, emails, some kind of messengers etc. It depends on problem difficulty, what easier and what exactly consume more time
