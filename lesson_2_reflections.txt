-What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	Creates a new repository in current directory which contain initial
	commit. I need to do it, because this is a way to create a my own repository,
	which I will use to work with.

-How is the staging area different from the working directory and repository?
What value do you think it offers?

	Staging area is some kind of a buffer between working directory and
	repository. So on, we can choose, which file contained into the commit.
